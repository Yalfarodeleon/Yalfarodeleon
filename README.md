# Hi there, I'm Ysidro Alfaro De Leon. 👋

### Software Engineer | MSCS Student (AI/ML) @ Georgia Tech

I am a First-Generation Computer Science professional with a non-traditional path. My journey took 10 years of grit—transitioning from manual labor in boatyards to earning my B.S. in Computer Science, and now pursuing my **Master's in Machine Learning at Georgia Tech**.

I currently work at **Apple** (Specialist) while building my technical depth in Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence. I don't just write code; I solve problems with the resilience required to see them through.
